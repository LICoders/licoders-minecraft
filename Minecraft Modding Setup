In order to step into the world of Minecraft mods, there are a couple of steps we will need to get rolling.
Make sure you have about an hour to download and install everything. 

For these downloads, make sure you are downloading the builds that match your operating system. 
If you have a 32-bit operating system, all your downloads should be 32-bit (x86), and the same 
should be for 64-bit (x64). You can find this information about your computer by: 

Click the Windows button on your bottom task bar or on your keyboard
Right click on 'Computer' and select 'Properties'
You will view information about the operating system in the window that opens up like the following

Now to start downloading. 
The things we are going to want to get going are:

<a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre6downloads-1902815.html'>Java 
Runtime Environment (JRE)</a> and 
<a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk6downloads-1902814.html'>Java 
Development Kit (JDK)</a> which you can download from the provided links. They are for versions 
6 as that is more popular allowing your mod to be run on different computers with this version

You will also want an integrated development environment (IDE). This is where you will actually 
be coding. For our examples and lessons, we are going to use 
<a href='http://www.eclipse.org/downloads'>Eclipse</a>

The last puzzle piece is <a href='http://adf.ly/673885/http://files.minecraftforge.net/minecraftforge/minecraftforge-src-recommended.zip'>Minecraft Forge</a>. 
This is a package that allows you to rebuild any and 
all parts of Minecraft to your liking. It contains the source files we will need to start working 
with. Make sure you extract the files in this package to a location that you know you can access. 
For me, I'm going to put it in "C:\dev\".

Now that all of these are downloaded, we are going to want to install Forge. Open the folder 
you have your files in and run the install script ("install.cmd" for Windows). It takes a little 
bit to run but it allows all the files to access the right information about your Java environment
that we installed on your computer. 

Once this is done, we can start booting up Eclipse. This application does not need to be installed. 
After you download it, you can just double-click the application file and Eclipse will run, so let's 
go to where you installed it and double-click the "eclipse.exe" file

You will be asked where you would like your workplace to be. Forge already has the project setup for 
you, so we are going to want to direct it to where you installed Forge. For me, I put 
"C:\dev\forge\mcp\eclipse", and click "OK". 

At this point, your environment it ready to go. If you click the run button on the top toolbar 
(it looks like a play button), the application will boot up and you will be able to play Minecraft.

The follow up to this tutorial will provide boilerplate code, or code that you would use to start 
generating a mod of your own. Hang tight coders!
